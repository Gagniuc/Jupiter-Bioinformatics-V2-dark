# Jupiter Bioinformatics V2 (dark)
<kbd>Jupiter Bioinformatics (V2 - dark)</kbd> - To find similarities between two words, a manual comparison is required. For words between 4 and 8 letters, such a task can be performed by any of us without the use of a computer. However, what if the objects of comparison are entire phrases/sequences/files? Then the number of possibilities for different matches increases exponentially and no biological entity can do it by paper computing (to my knowledge). Computational solutions for these problems exist, such as different implementations of sequence alignment algorithms. The sequence alignment algorithms are as old as the field of Bioinformatics, however, these implementations were rarely done with soul. Below, the screenshot shows a new open source application designed in <kbd>native JavaScript</kbd>, that is able to align two sequences/texts in order to match the regions that are similar. Different interesting experimental designs can be accomplished with it, starting from bioinformatics/genetics to grammar and language studies. In mathematics for instance, such a strategy can be used in research to align the digits of irrational numbers or number sequences in general to find out the similarities between them. The software is called <kbd>Bio-Jupiter</kbd> and is fully independent of the internet. A simple <kbd>save as HTML</kbd> file on the local computer is sufficient for a use without the Internet connection. For future readings on the topic of machine learning algorithms, please see the other free applications that come with the book entitled Algorithms in Bioinformatics: Theory and Implementation.
